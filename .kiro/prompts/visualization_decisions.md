Prompt:
What visualizations best show the relationship between weather and food orders
without implying causation?

Outcome:
Line chart for trends, bar comparison for rainy vs non-rainy days,
and scatter plot for temperature vs demand.

Notes:
- Prefer simple, explainable charts and clear labels.
- Show distributions and correlations without causal language.
- Surface key context (date range, rainy-day counts, imputed weather %) near the charts.
